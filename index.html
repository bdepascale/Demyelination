              Demyelination of neurons can occur due to several types of diseases, most commonly are forms of Multiple Sclerosis. The majority of
              these cause the bodies immune system to attack the myelin sheath. The sheath acts like an insulator and allows for neurons to transmit
              signals up to 100 times faster than un-myelinated neurons through a process known as saltatory conduction. Saltatory conduction allows
              for the building of larger action potentials along the neuron thus allowing the signal to jump from one Node of Ranvier to the next. As
              the bodyâ€™s immune system breaks down the myelin the neuron loses its ability to carry out saltatory conduction and the neuron physiology
              changes to use less efficient voltage gated sodium channels, which are much closer together than Nodes of Ranvier, allowing for much
              smaller jumps down the neuron. This slows down the neuron conduction and in extreme cases the signal strength can fade completely before
              reaching the end of the neuron resulting in a total loss of that nerve impulse.
